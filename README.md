## Learning Outcomes
At the end of the module, students will be able to
- Describe the principles of and apply a variety of data structures and their associated algorithms
- Describe standard algorithms, apply a given pseudo code algorithm in order to solve a given problem, and carry out simple asymptotic analyses of algorithms
- Describe and apply different algorithm design principles and distinguish the differences between these principles
- Choose and justify the use of appropriate data structures to enable efficient implementation of algorithms
